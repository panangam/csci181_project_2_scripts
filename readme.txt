I have eight total plaintexts. Each contains only the letters a - z, periods
and spaces between words. I have encoded these as a - z (00000 - 11001), 
period (11010) and space (11011). There are no other symbols.

I paired up the eight plaintexts into four pairs. I XORed those pairs together.

Those four XORs are contained in the file c1.txt.

There are hints in the texts.

If you want hints on the themes of the texts, then you can request them. Peter Hilton,
who had to do this during World War II at Bletchley Park (the plaintexts were in German) 
told me that this project is not fair without the themes. He said at Bletchley Park they
knew the theme of a message from things like the source of a transmission and the time of
 day it was sent.
